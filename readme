Look, I needed this really fast because I was tired of climbing up and down ladders just to turn lights on and off. I thought it'd be much better to turn them off FROM the ladder. I coded it up in a total of about 6 hours- which includes all of the "I've never programmed in Android and left Java in 1995, but let's see what I can learn quickly" time.

What I'm trying to say is that this works FOR ME, NOW.

I'm gonna clean up the code ASAP, but right now, I have a show to do the lights for, and so I really just wanted a quick solution and was surprised no-one else did it.

Eventually, it'll be in the Android marketplaceâ€¦ but that won't be until after Anne of Green Gables is performed in Hood River :)
